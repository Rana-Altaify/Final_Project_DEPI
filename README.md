🚄 UK Railway Data Analytics
This project focuses on analyzing UK railway data to uncover insights related to customer behavior, train performance, journey timelines, and geographic trends. The analysis was done using Power BI and Python for data preprocessing and modeling.

📌 Project Description

We built a comprehensive data analytics solution for the UK Railway system using Power BI. The data was cleaned and processed using Python, then visualized through interactive dashboards to support data-driven decisions in transportation and customer service. The insights are based on ticket sales, journey performance, and station-level behavior.

🧠 Key Insights
📉 Cancellation Rate: Peak during weekends and certain stations.
⏱️ % On-Time Journeys: Lower in urban congested routes.
🎫 Average Ticket Price: Higher in longer-distance and weekend journeys.
📅 Purchasing Patterns: Most purchases happen 2–5 days before the journey.
📍 Hotspot Stations: Top stations with most journeys and delays identified.
📊 Dashboards
We developed four Power BI pages:

Customers' Behavior Analytics
Trains' Performance Analytics
Journey Timeline Analytics
Geographic Analytics

🛠 Tech Stack
Power BI – For building the dashboards
Python (Pandas, Numpy) – For data cleaning and processing
Power Query & DAX – For modeling and measures
GitHub – For version control and documentation
✅ Testing Approach
Unit Testing: Applied to individual Python functions during data cleaning (e.g., date format conversion, null value handling).
Integration Testing: Ensured the consistency and accuracy of combined data tables and DAX relationships in Power BI model.
📦 Deliverables
✅ Cleaned dataset (CSV format)
✅ Power BI Dashboard (.pbix)
✅ Python scripts (data cleaning + basic modeling)
✅ Documentation (PDF presentation, README file)
